# NER-tagger

The project is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) tagger built with PyTorch. It includes advanced features such as attention mechanisms, part-of-speech (POS) embeddings, and character-level embeddings to enhance the model's understanding of sequences. Below is the detailed structure of the project, hyperparameters used, and improvements to the NERtagger.
